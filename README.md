# Styrene – a package bundler

Styrene makes usable app bundles for Windows.
It repacks MSYS2 software into neat bundles that are nicer for your users,
and easier for you to distribute.
If a package containing your app is already available in MSYS2,
it can be bundled with Styrene.

## Documentation

Styrene’s documentation is maintained with Sphinx.
You will eventually be able to read it on readthedocs.io,
but for now you can browse through the [docs](docs) folder
on github or in your local copy.

## Licensing

* [GPLv3](COPYING) for the tool itself.
* [CC0][cc0] for code templates and generated code inside bundles.

See the Styrene [licensing policy][pol] in the documentation
for details of why we make this split.
