# Styrene – a package bundler

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/styrene/badge/?version=latest)](http://styrene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Styrene makes usable app bundles for Windows.
It repacks MSYS2 software into neat bundles that are nicer for your users,
and easier for you to distribute.
If a package containing your app is already available in MSYS2,
it can be bundled with Styrene.
