    This kickoff script has to get rid of the directory housing this
    startup script from sys.path. Setuptools, and thus pip3, sometimes
    installs things in a funny way that creates an additional styrene.py
    on the MSYS2/Windows platform despite our best efforts. It's never
    right for that to be the styrene module.
