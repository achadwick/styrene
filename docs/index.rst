Styrene – a package bundler
===========================

`Styrene`_ makes usable app bundles for Windows.
It repacks MSYS2 software into neat bundles that are nicer for your users,
and easier for you to distribute.
If a package containing your app is already available in MSYS2,
it can be bundled with Styrene.
You can also bundle packages you build yourself.
